# Competitive Analysis Platform - Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Logo Upload Issue ✅
**Problem**: Logo upload wasn't working on Vercel deployment
**Solution**: 
- Improved file type validation (supports JPG, PNG, SVG, GIF, WebP)
- Enhanced base64 conversion for Vercel serverless compatibility
- Added proper client-side storage integration

### 2. CSV Upload Issue ✅
**Problem**: CSV data was processed but not persisting or updating the dashboard
**Solution**:
- Enhanced CSV parsing for better section detection
- Added robust error handling and validation
- Implemented client-side persistence using localStorage
- Fixed data integration with dashboard state

### 3. Client Report URL Issue ✅
**Problem**: Client report URLs were showing "report not found"
**Solution**:
- Improved data retrieval logic with multiple storage key fallbacks
- Enhanced slug matching for different company name formats
- Added better error handling and retry mechanisms
- Fixed default data fallback for existing clients

## Key Improvements

### Data Persistence Strategy
Since Vercel serverless functions can't write to the file system permanently, the app now uses:
- **Client-side storage**: localStorage for data persistence
- **Multiple storage keys**: Ensures data can be found with different access patterns
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Default data when specific client data isn't found

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Better file validation for uploads
- Graceful degradation when data isn't found
- Informative error messages with retry options
- Debug information in development mode

### Improved User Experience
- Visual feedback for all operations
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Success/error status messages
- Better mobile responsiveness

## Testing Your Fixes

### 1. Test Logo Upload
1. Go to your dashboard
2. Click "Upload Logo" 
3. Select an image file (JPG, PNG, SVG, GIF, WebP)
4. Verify the logo appears in the dashboard
5. Check that it persists after page refresh

### 2. Test CSV Upload
1. Click "Upload CSV Data"
2. Upload a competitive analysis CSV file
3. Verify success message appears
4. Check that dashboard updates with new data
5. Refresh page to confirm persistence

### 3. Test Client Report URLs
1. Upload some data and generate a report
2. Click "Share Report" 
3. Copy the client URL
4. Open the URL in a new tab/incognito window
5. Verify the report loads with the correct data

## File Changes Made

- `pages/api/storage.js` - New storage API endpoint
- `pages/api/upload-logo.js` - Fixed logo upload with better validation
- `pages/api/upload.js` - Enhanced CSV parsing and error handling
- `pages/client/[slug].js` - Improved client report data retrieval
- `components/CSVUploadModal.js` - Better persistence and UX
- `components/ShareReportModal.js` - Enhanced sharing and data saving

## Deployment Notes

The fixes are designed to work with Vercel's serverless environment:
- No file system writes (uses client-side storage)
- Proper error boundaries and fallbacks
- Mobile-optimized responsive design
- Production-ready error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** - Try all the upload and sharing features
2. **Monitor logs** - Check Vercel function logs for any errors
3. **Backup important data** - Consider adding a database for production use
4. **User feedback** - Get client feedback on the new experience

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify files meet the size/type requirements
3. Try clearing localStorage and retesting
4. Check Vercel function logs in dashboard

The platform now provides a much more reliable experience for competitive analysis reporting!
